An Interactable Orbital Physics Engine written in C++ and the SFML library.

Features the ability to click and drag to move around, zoom in and out using the scroll wheel, and snap to objects by clicking on them.

The solar system is preloaded, and the moon/planets/sun are displayed to scale.

Currently working on refactoring the code.
